      <h1 id="messageTitle">About Linus</h1>
      <p>Sebastian founded Linus Media Group in January 2013 out of a garage, with Luke Lafreniere, Edzel Yago, and Brandon Lee. The group developed the Linus Tech Tips channel as an independent venture. Sebastian also began working on Techquickie.
        
        In September 2013, Sebastian was interviewed by Chris Pirillo. Sebastian discussed the future of his channel and answered questions that had been sent to Pirillo through social media.
        
        In a 2014 interview, Sebastian revealed he had sleepless nights under the pressure of figuring out how to support his family while also employing staff during the early days of his independent YouTube career, having had no startup capital to work with.
        
        In 2015, the company moved into a commercial office space for the first time, having previously worked out of a residential address in Langley, BC. The moving process was documented in a series of vlogs that became one of the most acclaimed series of videos in the Linus Tech Tips channel history. Since then, Sebastian has infrequently created office vlogs following the move.
        
        As of May 8, 2017, the Linus Tech Tips, Techquickie, and the ChannelSuperFun channel each is home to 3685 videos, 423 videos, and 138 videos respectively, including product reviews and advice, build logs, vlogs, and original web series. The Tech Tips channel posts a video every day.</p>
